# Overview

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, the goal is to automatically classify **grain varieties** from images of individual grains.

In real agricultural settings, different grain varieties are often **sown together** in the same field. After harvest, the final proportions of each variety may change due to differences in growth, resistance to disease, or adaptation to the environment. To study these effects, it is important to identify which grain belongs to which variety after harvest.

To address this problem, **hyperspectral imaging** is used. This type of imaging captures rich spectral information that makes it possible to distinguish between visually similar grain varieties. However, this data is complex and requires machine learning models to analyze it effectively.

Participants are asked to build models that classify grain images into the correct variety.

## What Is the Task?

* You are given images of **individual grains**.
* Each image belongs to **one of 8 grain varieties**.
* Your task is to predict the correct variety for each image.

This is a **multi-class image classification** problem.

## Who Can Participate?

This challenge is designed for:

* Students in machine learning, computer vision, or data science
* Researchers interested in agricultural data
* Anyone who wants to practice image classification on real-world data

No prior experience with hyperspectral data is required.
